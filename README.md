## Personal Website

This is the open source repository of my personal website, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/), [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### See the site live at:

## Build

Since this project was built with React, the first thing you'll need is a Code Editor.

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed in your computer, and run:

```console
yarn create react-app
```

2. Then, clone the repository and change into the working directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/pedro-areal-torres/Website-Portfolio
cd Website-Portfolio
```

3. Install all the necessary dependencies:

```console
yarn install
```

4. Start the development server with:

```console
yarn start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

5. Finally, if you want to build the application, use:

```console
yarn build
```
